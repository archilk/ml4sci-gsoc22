Because there are 3 classes, the AUC is calculated as the average of the AUCs of the individual classes.

The given train set is divided in a 90:10 ratio into "train" and "validation" sets. This "validation" set is used for hyperparameter tuning.
The given val set is considered as the external train set.
Thus, there are 3 sets in total.

Train AUC: 99.67% <br/>
Validation AUC: 99.32% <br/>
Test AUC: 99.24% <br/>
